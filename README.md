# Programming Languages
This repository contains a collection of practical tasks for learning the syntax of the listed programming languages.

If you want to use the same tasks to learn, you can choose the language and navigate through each folder and complete the tasks in order of their difficulty. Just make sure you don't copy my code :).
Try to do the tasks by yourself. That is how we learn.


`HAPPY CODING`

## 📘 Beginner Tasks (1–5)

### 1. Create a List of Numbers
- Create a list with 10 random integers.
- Print the list, its length, and its data type.

### 2. Access List Elements
- Print the first, middle, and last elements of the list.

### 3. Update and Replace Elements
- Change the third element to a new value.
- Replace the last two elements with `0`.

### 4. Append, Insert, and Extend
- Append a number to the end of the list.
- Insert a number at index 2.
- Extend the list with `[99, 100]`.

### 5. Remove Items
- Remove the last item using `pop()`.
- Remove a specific value using `remove()`.

## ⚙️ Intermediate Tasks (6–10)

### 6. List Slicing Practice
- Print the first 5 items using slicing.
- Print the list in reverse using slicing.

### 7. Find Max, Min, Sum, and Average
- Use `max()`, `min()`, and `sum()` functions.
- Calculate the average of the list.

### 8. Check for Existence
- Ask the user for a number and check if it exists in the list using `in`.

### 9. Count and Index
- Count how many times a number appears using `count()`.
- Find the index of a specific number using `index()`.

### 10. Sort and Reverse
- Sort the list in ascending order.
- Reverse the list using `reverse()`.

## 🧩 Advanced Tasks (11–15)

### 11. Filter Even Numbers
- Use list comprehension to create a new list with only the even numbers.

### 12. Remove Duplicates
- Remove duplicate values without using `set()`.

### 13. Merge Two Lists
- Merge your list with another list using a loop (not `+` or `extend()`).

### 14. Find Common Elements Between Two Lists
- Print all values that exist in both lists.

### 15. Build a Nested List Structure
- Create a 2D list (3 sublists, each with 3 integers).
- Print the nested list in matrix format (row by row).

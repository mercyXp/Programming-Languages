# Advanced Control Flow with Python's Match Case

Python's if/else statements are control flow workhorses, but managing intricate conditions can get messy. Enter Match Case (Python 3.10+), a powerful tool for handling these situations with more clarity and elegance.

## Concept Overview

### Topics Covered:
- **Understanding Match Case**: Grasp the concept of Match Case statements and their advantages for handling multiple conditions compared to traditional if/else chains.
- **Match Case Syntax and Examples**: Dive deep into the syntax with practical examples demonstrating how to match against specific values, ranges, and even data types.
- **Best Practices for Match Case**: Learn guidelines for using Match Case statements effectively, focusing on readability, efficiency, and understanding when it's the most suitable choice for your code.

### Learning Objectives:
- Learn to use Match Case statements introduced in Python 3.10 as an alternative to multiple if/elif statements
- Understand the advantages of Match Case over traditional conditional statements
- Apply Match Case in practical programming scenarios

## Overview of Match Case Statements and Their Advantages

Imagine a program that needs to react differently based on various user inputs. Traditionally, you might rely on a series of if, else, and elif statements. While these are essential, managing intricate conditions can lead to:

- **Less Readable Code**: Growing conditions make code cluttered and hard to understand
- **Harder to Maintain**: Modifying nested if/else blocks becomes error-prone

**Match Case advantages**:
- Improved readability with clear structure
- Explicit matching conditions
- Optional exhaustiveness checking
- Cleaner code for complex scenarios

## Syntax and Examples

### Basic Syntax:
```python
match expression:
    case pattern1:
        code_block_1
    case pattern2:
        code_block_2
    ...
    case _:  # Default case
        default_code
```

### Matching Specific Values:
```python
day = input("Enter a day: ").lower()

match day:
    case "monday":
        print("Ugh, Mondays...")
    case "tuesday":
        print("Just another workday...")
    case "wednesday":
        print("Hump day!")
    case "saturday" | "sunday":  # Multiple values
        print("Weekend vibes!")
    case _:
        print("Invalid day")
```

### Matching Data Types:
```python
value = input("Enter a value: ")

match value:
    case int():
        print("Integer:", value)
    case str():
        print("String:", value)
    case _:
        print("Invalid type")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Prioritize clarity** over conciseness
2. **Always include a default case** (`_`)
3. **Use guards** for complex logic within cases
4. **Consider exhaustiveness** for critical applications

Example with guard:
```python
age = int(input("Enter age: "))

match age:
    case 18 | 19 if has_id(user):  # Guard
        print("Eligible to vote")
    case _:
        print("Not eligible")
```

## Challenge: Number Guessing Game

Create a game where users guess a secret number using Match Case:

```python
import random

def number_guess_game():
    secret = random.randint(1, 10)
    attempts = 0
    
    while True:
        guess = int(input("Guess (1-10): "))
        attempts += 1
        
        match guess:
            case x if x == secret:
                print(f"Correct! Guesses: {attempts}")
                break
            case x if x > secret:
                print("Too high!")
            case _:
                print("Too low!")
                
    if input("Play again? (y/n): ").lower() == 'y':
        number_guess_game()

number_guess_game()
```

### Bonus Challenge:
- Track number of guesses
- Display guess count when correct
- Add difficulty levels

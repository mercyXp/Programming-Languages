# Hello, World Project

This repository contains my solutions for the "0x00. Python - Hello, World" project from ALX's Software Engineering curriculum.

## Project Overview

- **Project Name**: Python - Hello, World
- **Duration**: 1 day | 24 hours
- **Concepts**: Python programming fundamentals

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, I learned about:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- The history of Python (created by Guido van Rossum)
- The origin of the name 'Python'
- The Zen of Python principles
- Using the Python interpreter
- Printing text and variables
- String manipulation (indexing, slicing)
- Python coding style (PEP8/pycodestyle)

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:

### Mandatory Tasks
1. `0-run` - Shell script that runs a Python script
2. `1-run_inline` - Shell script that runs Python code
3. `2-print.py` - Prints a specific string
4. `3-print_number.py` - Prints an integer with string
5. `4-print_float.py` - Prints a float with precision
6. `5-print_string.py` - Manipulates and prints a string
7. `6-concat.py` - Concatenates strings
8. `7-edges.py` - String slicing operations
9. `8-concat_edges.py` - Advanced string concatenation
10. `9-easter_egg.py` - Prints "The Zen of Python"
11. `10-check_cycle.c` - C function to detect linked list cycles

### Advanced Tasks
12. `100-write.py` - Prints to stderr and exits with status 1
13. `101-compile` - Script that compiles Python code
14. `102-magic_calculation.py` - Python function matching given bytecode

## Resources Used

During this project, I referred to:
- The Python tutorial (first three chapters)
- Python string formatters
- Pycodestyle style guide
- Various Python documentation

## Personal Notes

This was my first Python project in the ALX curriculum. It helped me transition from C to Python programming, focusing on fundamental concepts like:
- Python syntax basics
- String manipulation
- Printing and formatting output
- Following Python style guidelines

The project was challenging but rewarding, especially tasks like the linked list cycle detection in C and the bytecode interpretation.

## How to Use

To run any of the Python scripts:
```bash
chmod +x filename.py
./filename.py
```

For C files, compile with:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic filename.c -o output
```
